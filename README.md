What's this all about?
===

Learning, mostly. Learning how to build a scaling service, learning how to store data without impacting the user, learning how to provide a great user experience, learning about what the user really wants and figuring out what he might need although he doesn't know yet.

And fun of course. Because building this is done in spare time it should be as much fun as possible :)
