Data stored by the service and their usage
---

First of all: our motto is user data privacy first!

"usage data"
---

As stated in the goal we try to provide the best user experience possible. In doing so we will store data about how users use this service and perform analyses on that data (called "usage data").

"user data"
---

We will *not* store any kind of personal information (called "user data" or "personal data") without the users permission. If the user provides us his permission by entering his data, accepting our data policy and then pressing the "save" button, we will store his user data. If the user decides to provide such information to our service we will store personal data encrypted so that in case of data breach the extraction of personal data is as hard as possible.
Please understand that it is technically impossible to guarantee the event of personal data exposal to never happen. We promise to handle user data with maximum sensitivity and will never store it unencrypted.
